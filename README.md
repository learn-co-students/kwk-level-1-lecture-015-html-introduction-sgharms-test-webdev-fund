# Introduction to HTML

**Note:** This lecture involves a lot of show-and-tell with the students (after all, seeing is believing)! Prep and 'making the lecture our own' is key. The basics of HTML can be lackluster when provided in text-book format. Lucky for us, HTML is so easy to bring to life with the browser. This should be a constant back and forth between lecture/explanation and looking at results in Chrome/Firefox/Internet Explorer. Make sure you read through these notes before hand and have your example flow prepared!

## Objectives

This lesson will focus on introducing students to the essentials of HTML, as well as its real interaction in the browser. As opposed to taking a "memorize the top used tags" approach, this lesson focuses on communicating the higher level concepts of HTML.

## SWBATS

HTML - Communicate the role of HTML
HTML - Identify the core tags
HTML - Create a browser ready HTML file

## Introduction

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a **markup language** which describes the structure and organization of web pages. Web browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome read HTML and use it to display websites. Unlike Ruby, JavaScript, and other programming languages, markup languages like HTML don't have any logic behind them (we can't make an `array.each` with plain HTML).

Every website you use is running with HTML as the core component that describes how it looks. 

**NOTE:** Show students the Chrome developer tools. Specifically, show them the HTML of some website. Perhaps ask them "Someone give me a website. Let's look at the HTML for it!" Following, go to the website, open up Chrome developer tools, (`command + option + i` on mac, or right click), and go to the 'Elements' tab. From there, do something with an immediate visual effect (i.e. change the text on some major title element). 

Ok, so now you 'hacked' the page. In front of the whole class, you altered the data on a webpage. Of course, we didn't really change the webpage. If someone else goes to the website, they won't see the changes you made. What actually happened then?

**Note:** Now is an excellent time to describe that the HTML you received was only a copy of the real website, sent from their server, to our computer. Don't take for granted that this might be a completely new concept to many of your students. Our computer's browser (Chrome, in this case) simply got a copy of the HTML/CSS/JavaScript from the server behind the URL we went to, and presented a **copy** of it. If we make changes in our browser, all we are changing is the copy of it, _not_ the actual website.

## HTML Fundamentals

We want to get you guys building a website ASAP and having fun with HTML. We could spend weeks examining different specifics of HTML, but there is only one core concept we need to teach to get you successfully adding things to the screen:

##### Elements

HTML consists of different elements. Most elements use a 'tag' to identify what kind of element they are. This 'tag' wraps around content. Take a look at our most basic HTML element:

```HTML
<div>
  Hello, World!
</div>
```

**Note:** Throw this in a brand new file (`file-name.html`) and open it up in Chrome. Alter the inner text and then refresh to show them the change. 

In this example, the `<div>` element/tag is just the HTML communicating: "Hey, this is general division of content. Everything in here belongs to this `<div>` element." 

Let's see what happens when add a header tag to the top level of our HTML:

```HTML
<h1> 
  This text is wrapped inside a header element! 
</h1>

<div>
  Hello, World!
</div>
```

**Note:** Refresh to show the changes

As we see, text is rendering to the screen differently when its inside of a different tag. In this case, the `<h1>` tag is specifically saying "I represent header content." 

Elements can also be nested within others, Ã  la:

```HTML
<h1> 
  This text is wrapped inside a header element! 
</h1>

<div>
  <h1>
    This section shows how different tags manage whitespace
  </h1>
  
  <div>
    I am not haiku
    Newlines mean nothing to divs
    One line, must I be
  </div>
  
  <pre>
    I am a haiku
    Wrapped in a preserved text tag
    My line breaks you see
  </pre>
  
  
</div>
```

Elements aren't just for text, they are for every type of content we experience on web pages. There exist elements for: 
  - displaying lists
  - saying what the text on the top of the page tab should be
  - drawing pictures on the page
  - images
  - sounds (that's right, not just visual things!)
  - scripts (they surround custom programs that interact with our website)
  - and many more!

**Student 10 minute Student Empowerment Pair Exercise:** First, show students how to open an html file from your computer in Chrome/their browser. Students should the break up into small groups and work on the following:
  - Create a new HTML file
  - Find out (with Google-fu) what tag is used to represent images and GIFs
  - Find our how those tags use urls to link images/GIFs
  - Use the following url in the correct tag to get the GIF displaying when they open the file with Chrome: https://gph.to/2JFqv97

**Note:** Bring the class back together and grab some solutions from students. Dissect as a group what the "src=" part of the tag is for (some groups may not have been successful, so explore the solution from the beginning). This will transition us nicely into **attributes!**. 

## HTML Attributes

Attributes flesh a tag out by providing additional information. A simple example is the `<img src="imageurl.gif">` attribute, which was used to provide more context to the image tag. Without the source value, all we have is the skeleton of a tag, and it has no clue what content it should be displaying! 

Attributes have a wide variety of jobs, from describing the size, color, and other visual facets of a tag to the sound file that it should play. Let's see how we can use attributes to describe more specific visual effects:

```HTML
<body style="background-color:blue">
  
</body>
```

Don't worry at this point about memorizing which attributes do what, or which tags are most appropriate where. There are simply too many tags and attributes to memorize in one sitting. Your time is better spent using your Google-fu whenever you encounter an obstacle to displaying what you would like to in HTML.
